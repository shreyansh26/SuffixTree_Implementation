Suffix Tree
===========

This repository serves as a demo implementation of **Suffix Tree** done in the C Programming Language. **Suffix Tree** was used to solve the longest common substring problem (one of the standard problems in the String category). The other two implementations of LCS are also provided for comparison.

This was a project done by us as a part of our **Data Structures** course under the guidance of Prof. S.K Singh.
